# WIDAR: Real-time Wildlife Intrusion Detection & Response System
*(A real-time wildlife intrusion detection and deterrence system)*

WIDAR is a system that automatically detects wildlife appearing near residential areas and farms using video-based monitoring, then triggers visual and auditory stimuli to deter animals based on the detection results. It detects wildlife presence in camera footage using a deep learning-based object detection model. When wildlife is detected, the system activates deterrence devices to prevent animals from approaching.
